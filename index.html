						<p>Area B at the Gabii excavation site is known for its necropolis area. We investigated grave sites, tombs, and various skeletons in this area in order to learn more about the burial rituals during this time period. Rituals include ways of preparing the body for burial, burying the dead with particular objects, or various post funeral practices. The burial of people of status and of different ages was also looked into. 
</b>Our Unity Project is below and is made into a museum setup. The walls and rooms are the same layout as Area B was found, but the artifacts inside each room are not in their exact locations. We divided artifacts into rooms based on what they were. The large room has a section for cappucina, skeletons/grave linings, and pottery found. One of the smaller rooms deals with infant burial and the other with the burial of Lordy Gaga.</p>

											<h3>INFANT BURIAL</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Infant death rates were estimated to be as high as 60% in ancient Latium, and typically families considered even young children to be infants. Also, infants were buried within the city if they were between 0-5 years of age, which is why so many infant burials were excavated in area B (see SUs 1063, 1139, 1142, 1372 in Unity). In SU 1142, the infant was buried in a cappuccina style tomb on a marble slab, indicating that this child was from a family of higher status, compared to the infant in SU 1063, who was buried in an oval pit. </p>

											<h3>COMMON BURIAL RITUALS</h3>
										</header>
										<p>A common burial ritual for the people of Gabii is termed inhumation, where the dead are put to rest in a supine position, under the weight of the earth. Within Unity, the skeletons in SU 1010 and SU 1037 are both buried supine. Bodies were placed inside a coffin or sarcophagus as Lola was in SU 1358 in Unity, and they may have been buried with certain objects such as a ceramic vessel or coinage. SU 1046 in Unity is an example of an intricate elite burial within a cappuccina, or a set of tiles that create a peaked cover of the tomb, and a dolia vessel (SU 1033) was most likely related to this burial or its funerary activities.</p>

											<h3>RELIGION</h3>
										</header>
										<p>As seen in SU 1046 in Unity, the grave is orientated N-S, which does not conform to usual Christian burial practice. The normal orientation is E-W, which is what the majority of graves are like in Area B. </p>

											<h3>POST FUNERAL PRACTICES</h3>
										</header>
										<p>There are various rituals that are performed after the funeral. This can include a period of cleansing ceremonies and rituals involving food. A feast is normal to take place as well as a meal eaten at the grave nine days after the burial. Food is also left at the tomb as an offering and meals are eaten there throughout the year. Cemeteries have even been known to have kitchens. </p>

						<p> Since Allison and I were beginners to technology software and html coding, we decided to learn and understand the basics to create a unity project and webpage with the basics. By designing our unity project as a museum, we were able to group similar findings from area B together so that we could fully explain the burial rituals associated with them. Within unity, we were able to create walls, 3D models, and infosprites to the best of our abilities. We found an error with our game-mode camera, and, despite our best efforts, we were unable to fix this bug. Within the webpage, we coded images and information related to the burial rituals we discussed in Unity. </p>
